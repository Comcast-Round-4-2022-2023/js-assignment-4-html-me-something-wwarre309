               <h2>Pusha T</h2>
               <p>
                  "In April of 2022, Pusha T released arguably the best rap album of the year. The collection of hits Pusha recorded and released to the streets included 'Scrape it off' featuring Lil Uzi & Don Toliver, 'Rock n Roll' featuring Kid Cudi & Kanye West, and 'Diet Coke'. Pusha's mix of witty wordplay and smooth beat production earned him a grammy nomination that year. I remember listening to his album for the first time and thinking to myself that I had to see him perform on his tour. The universe must've heard me loud and clear because the next day, several friends in my groupchat suggested we all go the concert together. Leave it to music to bring friends that live a distance away together. Aside from being around cool people, the concert was oretty enjoyable even though Pusha T came out 3 hours after doors opened without any opening acts"

               <h2>Lil Uzi Vert</h2>
               <p>
                  "2016 is always referenced as one of the greatest years for music and Lil Uzi Vert helped play a significant role in that. With his release of his album Lil Uzi Vs The World, all the parties and clubs will never be the same. Lil Uzi gave us classics such as 'Money Longer', 'Canadian Goose' and 'Ps & Qs' that brought a different vibe to my music playlist. Being in Philadelphia, at some point you're bound to run into Lil Uzi. I actually met him 2 seperate occasions, though I doubt he'd remember. His sets at Made in America always had some dope visuals to go with his performances."

               <h2>Cardi B</h2>
               <p>
                  "From reality TV show personality to Hip Hop icon, Cardi B has had one of the greatest rises to fame in recent history. In 2018, Cardi B exploded on the scene with her debut album 'Invasion of Privacy' that landed her a couple grammys. Some of the best songs she made on that album included 'Bodak Yellow', 'I Like It' featuring J Balvin & Bad Bunny, and 'Drip' featuring Migos. I was fortunate enough to watch her first perform at Made in America on a side stage, and still had one of the biggest crowds there. She only has one album that dropped more than 5 years ago, yet she continues to stay relevant and drop hits every year. When she headlined Made in America in 2019 it was definitely a top 5 show I witnessed"

               <h2>Travis Scott</h2>
               <p>
                  "Honestly, there aren't many artists that can make amazing music and be an even more amazing performer but Travis Scott has the perfect blend. The best Made in America weekend i ever attended was when Travis Scott was the headliner. When I tell the energy this guy brought to the stage was unmatched. I've never seen such a display if crowd control with fire music and getting the crowd involved. Every single song he played was shouted by everyone at the top of their lungs and incorporated fireworks and dope visuals. He played some of my favorite songs from his 'Birds in the Trap Sing Mcknight' album like 'Way Back', 'Pick Up The Phone' featuring Young Thug & Quavo, and 'Goosebumps' featuring Kendrick Lamar which he played 5 times in a row and each time was better than the last.
